As one of three presentations at the October meetup of the [CNPDX group](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-PDX), Ryan Rich, Datica Chief Product Officer, will present on "Achieving HIPAA & GDPR compliance on Kubernetes." The meetup starts at 6:00pm at [New Relic](https://goo.gl/maps/qHQXpPMaWbw).

Achieving compliance is more than just installing a logging stack and implementing a few monitoring alerts. In this talk, Ryan will discuss the intricacies of achieving compliance in the cloud and how Kubernetes and the CNCF ecosystem play a part.
