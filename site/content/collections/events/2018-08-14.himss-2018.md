The annual HIMSS conference in Las Vegas is one of the main events in healthcare for the year. For five days 45,000+ professionals from around the world will meet to discuss health information and technology. It is a singular experience to see cutting-edge products and solutions, and presents unique networking opportunities.

Datica will have an exciting announcement for our platform at HIMSS this year. Stop by our booth #5077 to hear the news. 

### Visit us at Booth #5077 for a chance to get a Yeti&reg;!

While you're visiting the booth you can enter to win a YETI&reg; Rambler Lowball. We'll be giving away several YETIs every day on a first-come, first-served basis. Simply schedule a timeslot between 10:00 a.m. - 4 p.m. March 6th, 7th or 8th to reserve. If you're lucky enough to pick up this sweet little tumbler we'll fill it with La Colombe cold brew coffee, in either Pure Black or Draft Latte.

As conference veterans, we know how hard it is to find good coffee in the conference hall, let alone cold brew. Get ahead of the crowd and click the button below to schedule a meeting with our HIMSS team.
