  Datica strives to make life a bit easier for healthcare developers, so we did
  the dirty work of pouring through the master list of thousands of AWS
  re:Invent sessions to pick our top 25. 
lead: >
  Today is the day the session reservation system opened up for attendees of AWS
  re:Invent 2018. If this year is anything like [re:Invent last
  year](https://datica.com/blog/re-invent-day-2-looking-toward-the-future/), the
  sessions will fill really fast, so don’t delay in choosing your sessions. 


  Those of you who know Datica already know that one of our main company goals
  is to make life a bit easier for developers of digital health products. In
  line with that goal, we did the dirty work for you of pouring through the
  [master list of thousands of
  sessions](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/search.ww) to hone
  in on the top 25 the Datica crew going to the re:Invent conference have
  selected to attend.

Look for our product team members, Ryan Rich, Chief Product Officer, and Anthony Pleshek, Product Manager, who will be sharpening their skills right along with you at these sessions. And, while you’re at re:Invent, stop by the Datica booth #1607 for a demo of any of our products, including the just-announced [Cloud Compliance Management System (CCMS)](https://datica.com/cloud-compliance-management-system/) and where we’ll be giving away Yeti tumblers and copies of our new book, [Complete Cloud Compliance](https://datica.com/innovation/complete-cloud-compliance-chapter-2/).

Without further ado, here’s our recommended list of AWS re:Invent sessions for healthcare developers. Get ‘em while they’re hot!
