  For health IT professionals, interoperability is a relatively new idea in the
  grand scheme of things – but that doesn’t mean that it hasn’t made a massive
  impact in recent years. Over the past half a decade, EHR interoperability has
  transformed from a goal to mandated practice. And, although most participating
  in today’s healthcare community would agree that adopting it is the right
  approach, providers, vendors, and patients alike are constantly facing
  complex, pricey systems and general misalignment.

EHR interoperability continues to be a challenge, especially when it comes to implementation and maintenance. And with new [specifications like FHIR](https://www.sansorohealth.com/what-is-fhir/) gaining widespread attention, the need for practical solutions for seamless interoperability is clearer than ever before. There’s also a lot of progress being made, particularly with the availability of robust API solutions (like [Emissary®](https://www.sansorohealth.com/emissary/)) that can overcome common interoperability hurdles like variations in [HL7 implementation](https://www.sansorohealth.com/hl7-integration-challenges-and-how-to-solve-them/).

As EHR interoperability is a popular topic of discussion within the health IT community – as well as the healthcare community at large – there’s a lot of information out there. To help cut through the noise, we’ve compiled a list of the top 50 articles, blogs, organizations, and white papers on the subject. Below you’ll find a list of the most valuable EHR interoperability resources, whether you’re a vendor, provider, patient, or an ancillary organization. They’re not ranked or rated in any way, but they are listed alphabetically by category for easy reference.

![achieving interoperability in healthcare](/assets/general/blog/achieving_interoperability_in_healthcare.webp?w=350)

Last spring, Becker’s Health IT & CIO Report published “Achieving
Interoperability in Healthcare,” a piece that serves as a short, yet powerful “how-to” for healthcare data experts working at a variety of levels. To better assess the given information, Becker’s share the interoperability best practices upsides, which include heightened visibility, streamlined operability, augmented finances, and more thorough clinical benefits.

__Three key takeaways from “Achieving Interoperability in Healthcare:”__

- Most working in healthcare still face substantial roadblocks when it comes to achieving interoperability.
- Healthcare providers must work together towards achieving a common goal.
- A vast majority of providers still use a closed-model system.

## 2. [“Achieving The Interoperability Promise Of 21st Century Cures”](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20180618.138568/full/)

![Achieving the Interoperability Promise of 21st Century Cures](/assets/general/blog/Achieving_the_Interoperability_Promise_of_21st_Century_Cures.webp?w=350)

In “Achieving the Interoperability Promise of 21st Century Cures,” the Health Affairs blogs delves into the trials and successes experienced since interoperability has come into play in the public sector. The article outlines Congress’ Cures Act of 2016, which was enacted to speed up interoperability between the HHS and the ONC. Now several years out, Health Affairs gives its readers an update on how this change is going, and where they predict it will be in the future.

__Three key takeaways from “Achieving The Interoperability Promise Of 21st Century Cures:”__

- There are more than 100 regional health information exchanges and multiple national-level organizations that support the exchange of health information.
- Currently, experts are still finding limited transparency across networks due to a lack of participation.
- In order for this to be successful, anti-competitive practices must be adhered to.

## 3. [“Are Patients Ready for EHR Interoperability?”](https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/address-ehr-interoperability-concerns/) 
[@softwareadvice](https://twitter.com/softwareadvice)

![Are Patients Ready for EHR Interoperability?](/assets/general/blog/Are_Patients_Ready_for_EHR_Interoperability_.webp?w=350)

In Software Advice’s “Are Patients Ready for EHR Interoperability?” writer Lisa Hedges takes a deep dive into the current statistics and trends surrounding the topic since it has hit the mainstream. In particular, Hedges lays out and assesses two of the initiatives biggest challenges: “patient concerns about data security and the software market’s limited advances in interoperability tech/capabilities.”

__Key takeaways from “Are Patients Ready for EHR Interoperability?:”__

- 77-percent of patients report feeling at least “very” or “moderately comfortable” with the idea of their health records being shared by any authorized person within their state.
- Heightened interoperability can stamp out unnecessary testing.
- Today’s patients prefer for their records to be shared electronically via a provider portal.

## 4. [“Breaking Down the Silos: How to Achieve EHR interoperability”](http://www.healthcarebusinesstech.com/achieve-ehr-interoperability/) 
[@HealthBusTech](https://twitter.com/healthbustech)

![Breaking Down the Silos- How to Achieve EHR interoperability](/assets/general/blog/Breaking_Down_the_Silos-_How_to_Achieve_EHR_interoperability.webp?w=350)

While a vast majority working in the healthcare field would be quick to agree that it will still be some time until the country reaches full EHR interoperability, most are not able to identify the reasons for it as eloquently as the _Healthcare Business and Technology Blog_. In this article, Elizabeth Buckle blames the roadblocks on there being “too many silos” within organizations, a series of communication breakdowns which prevent “the vision of true interoperability” from being achieved.

__Key takeaways from “Breaking Down the Silos: How to Achieve EHR interoperability:”__

- True interoperability requires constant communication between a host of different parties, not just doctor and patient.
- Healthcare providers must focus on investing in centralized, cloud-based networks.
- Systems should handle multiple forms of communication including “demographics, financial information, immunization records,appointment summaries, scheduling information, clinical documents, orders and test results.”

## 5. [“EHR Interoperability: Why Is It So Difficult?”](https://www.carecloud.com/continuum/why-is-ehr-interoperability-so-difficult/) 
[@FollowContinuum](https://twitter.com/followcontinuum)

![EHR Interoperability Why Is It So Difficult](/assets/general/blog/EHR_Interoperability_Why_Is_It_So_Difficult.webp)

_Continuum_, CareCloud’s industry insight blog, recently took a deep dive into the many pitfalls of EHR interoperability in its article “EHR Interoperability: Why Is it So Difficult?” In the piece, we get a list of common challenges that providers face, but we also hear about the importance, and why interoperability must be at the forefront of change in the healthcare field. Dr. Farzad Mostashari, the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is quoted as saying that EHR interoperability is the key to “better healthcare and lower costs,”

__Key takeaways from “EHR Interoperability: Why Is It So Difficult?:”__

- Larger companies are not investing as quickly as they should because they feel that business could be lost if they give their patients more transparency.
- There exists a clear lack of performance standards in the government-initiated program.
- One of the reasons that interoperability is so difficult is the natural fragmentation of vendors.

## 6. [“EHRs: The Challenge of Making Electronic Data Usable and Interoperable”](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5565131/) 
[@NCBI](https://twitter.com/NCBI)

![EHR Making Electronic Data Usable and Interoperable](/assets/general/blog/EHR_Making_Electronic_Data_Usable_and_Interoperable.webp)

Yet another article that focuses in on the current struggles of interoperability is “EHRs: The Challenge of Making Electronic Data Useable and Interoperable.” The piece, which was published in the _Pharmacy and Therapeutics_ journal by Miriam Reisman includes a host of shocking facts concerning the lack of existing interoperability in today’s practices. Reisman argues that there must be a “cultural change” in order for this massive undertaking to be successful.

__Key takeaways from “EHRs: The Challenge of Making Electronic Data Usable and Interoperable:”__

- Providers feel that the future of interoperability lies in the hands of the vendor community.
- A majority of small-practice physicians are concerned about the financial impacts of EHR upgrades.

## 7. [“Fixing a Broken EHR: HIM Working in the Spotlight to Solve Common EHR Issues”](http://library.ahima.org/doc?oid=107569#.XH53epMzbG5) 
[@AHIMAResources](https://twitter.com/AHIMAResources)

![Fixing a Broken EHR](/assets/general/blog/Fixing_a_Broken_EHR.webp?w=350)

In AHIMA’s, “Fixing a Broken EHR: HIM Working in the Spotlight to Solve Common EHR Issues,” we get a holistic view into the interoperability-related hardware and software issues plaguing many of today’s providers. The article brings forth insight on the daily struggles of health information management providers (HIM), with many revealing an array of technical difficulties that point to a general lack of support within institutions. Writer Mary Butler aims to bring a spotlight to the weak points, and how they may be slowing the future of interoperability.

__Key takeaways from “Fixing a Broken EHR: HIM Working in the Spotlight to Solve Common EHR Issues:”__

- The HIM community regularly faces data issues which are either very difficult or impossible to correct.
- Because the systems are not working as they should be, some physicians fear that the communications errors are costing them face time with patients.
- Physicians utilize EHRs in a variety of ways, making it even more difficult for HIM to predict and fix problems.

## 8. [“Interoperability in EHR: The Medical Mine”](https://www.medicaleconomics.com/ehr/interoperability-ehr-medical-mine) 
[@MedEconomics](https://twitter.com/MedEconomics)

![Interoperability in EHR](/assets/general/blog/Interoperability_in_EHR.webp?w=350)

Last summer, Nita K. Thingalaya MD and Arunkumar N. Badi MD, PhD penned a piece for *Medical Economics* entitled “Interoperability in EHR: The Medical Mine.” In it, the doctors reveal the daily reality of EHR implementation, in particular, that so many patients and providers have been left “dissatisfied” with the system. The writers explain this “dissatisfaction” by giving the history and standards of EHR, before divulging their opinion on the topic; in order to be successful, EHR must be driven by physician input ahead of anything else.

__Key takeaways from “Interoperability in EHR: The Medical Mine:”__

- Physicians want data to be interpreted in the clinical sense.
- The discord of data silos is slowing down the dream of achieving total interoperability.
- The ultimate goal is for patients to be able to connect with all relevant providers in one place.

## 9. [“Interoperability Issues? Most Blame EHR Integration”](https://www.medpagetoday.com/practicemanagement/practicemanagement/77070) 
[@medpagetoday](https://twitter.com/medpagetoday)

![Interoperability Issues Blame EHR Integration](/assets/general/blog/Interoperability_Issues_Blame_EHR_Integration.webp?w=350)

At the end of 2018, _Medpage Today_ published a report conducted by Mandy Rother of HealthLeader Media. The piece, which serves as an update for initial implementation, dispels some myths attached to EHR, chiefly that it has slowed down interoperability as a whole. On the flip side, Rother reveals that there has actually been quite a bit of progress made in recent years, particularly in the scenarios of hospitals that use interoperability in all four domains – sending, receiving, finding, and integrating.

__Key takeaways from “Interoperability Issues? Most Blame EHR Integration:__

- Hospitals that engaged in all four areas of interoperability has increased by 41% in the last two years.
- 3 in 10 small, rural, and critical care hospitals can currently engage in all four areas.
- Many providers still struggle with interoperability timeliness, accessibility, and accuracy.

## 10. [“Interoperability Remains Limited, According to the National Academy of Medicine”](https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/interoperability-remains-limited-according-national-academy-medicine) 
[@HC_Finance](https://twitter.com/hc_finance)

![Interoperability Remains Limited](/assets/general/blog/Interoperability_Remains_Limited.webp)

Jeff Lagasse, Associate Editor for _Healthcare Finance_,  penned the report “Interoperability Remains Limited, According to the National Academy of Medicine,” a piece which was written in the fall of 2018. The article reveals a host of troubling facts attached to the current state of EHR interoperability, with the most shocking being that a majority of clinicians are reporting “burnout” when it comes to implementation. This mainly attributed to the “growing requirements and regulatory compliance” put on providers, necessities that are contributing to an excess of extra work, time, and money.

__Key takeaways from “Interoperability Remains Limited, According to the National Academy of Medicine:”__

- Most providers still feel that heightened interoperability would lead to less testing errors.
- Providers struggle to share information in real time.
- Providers and vendors must work together to purchase software that can interoperate.

## 11. [“Sorting through EHR Interoperability: A Modern Day Tower of Babel That Corrects Problems for Clinical Laboratories, Other Providers”](https://www.darkdaily.com/sorting-through-ehr-interoperability-a-modern-day-tower-of-babel-that-corrects-problems-for-clinical-laboratories-other-providers/)

In his piece for _Verywell Health_, “The Growing Importance of Health Data Interoperability,” Michael Rucker, PhD, MBA explores the various triumphs and pitfalls associated with EHR interoperability. Unlike many of the aforementioned articles, Rucker makes sure to highlight its many successes, and even includes thorough breakdowns for how these were achieved. There is also particular attention paid to how other countries are dealing with interoperability, mainly the ones that are experiencing positive results using the model.

__Key takeaways from “The Growing Importance of Health Data Interoperability:”__

- Developing and using common data models may be the key to overcoming the many EHR obstacles.
- Vendors may be more willing to cooperate if incentivized.
- Increasing EHR interoperability transparency will only lead to better healthcare.

## 13. [“The State Of Interoperability In Healthcare”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/05/31/the-state-of-interoperability-in-healthcare/#2daf9e3e262b) 
[@Forbes](https://twitter.com/Forbes)

![State of Interoperability in Healthcare](/assets/general/blog/State_of_Interoperability_in_Healthcare.webp?w=350)

In the fall of 2018, Luis Castillo, President and CEO of Ensocarepenned a piece for _Forbes_ entitled “The State of Interoperability in Healthcare.” In it, we get a well-rounded view of the various attitudes, benchmarks, and hard statistics surrounding the implementations in a wide range of practices and companies. Although Castillo admits that we still have “a long way to go” when it comes to achieving seamlessness, he still contends that, as a whole, the healthcare community is “getting there.”

__Key takeaways from “The State Of Interoperability In Healthcare:”__

- Castillo reports seeing many in the healthcare community “up for the task” of adopting interoperability.
- It will not be easily achieved unless providers embrace innovation.

Those new to the topic of EHR interoperability would benefit from reading co-founder of Mobisoft Infotech, Ritesh Patil’s piece “What is Interoperability and Why is it Important for Healthcare,” published in the _HealthWorks Collective Blog._ The industry expert gives quick, yet thorough breakdowns of the main domains in interoperability – including technical interoperability and semantic interoperability – and how both function within the massive undertaking which is universal EHR implementation.

__Key takeaways from “What Is Interoperability and Why Is It Important in Healthcare?”__

- A classic example of synthetic interoperability is message protocol.
- Most systems engineers overlook the importance of semantic interoperability.
- 30-percent of healthcare costs are wasted on secondary testing exacerbated by a lack of communication between practices.

## 15. [“Why EHR Data Interoperability is Such a Mess in 3 Charts”](https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/why-ehr-data-interoperability-such-mess-3-charts) 
[@healthitnews](https://twitter.com/healthitnews)

![Why EHR Data Interoperability is Such a Mess in 3 Charts](/assets/general/blog/Why_EHR_Data_Interoperability_is_Such_a_Mess_in_3_Charts.webp?w=350)

Writer Tom Sullivan didn’t hold back when he penned the article, “Why EHR Data Interoperability is Such a Mess In 3 Charts,” for _Healthcare IT News_. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the piece lists the many failures committed by providers since implementation, but it also provides real-life scenarios that led to them occurring in the first place. Like many other writers on this list, Sullivan points to the disparate systems utilized by vendors as one of the chief reasons why EHR interoperability is not where it should be today.

__Key takeaways from “Why EHR Data Interoperability is Such a Mess in 3 Charts:”__

- ONC and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services must lead the drive toward interoperability.
- Innovation cannot commence until vendors and hospitals begin to play on the same team.
- There currently exists too many data sources for the patient to benefit from.
