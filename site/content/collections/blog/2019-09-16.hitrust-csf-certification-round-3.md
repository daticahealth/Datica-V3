  HIPAA regulations create a barrier for makers of digital health products to
  adopt the cloud. Whether you are a digital health startup, a health system,
  payer, or life sciences organization, it takes an enormous amount of work to
  [get your digital health product off the ground](https://datica.com/dhsf/)
  while, at the same time, achieving and maintaining continuous HIPAA
  compliance.

At Datica, we address all the infrastructure-based HIPAA rules and regulations for customers. Customers sign a single Business Associate Agreement with us, which reduces the complexity of managing several BAAs.

Through us and through our BAA, customers are able to build and deploy onto the world’s best infrastructure providers like [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/health/) or [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/industries/healthcare/) without having to worry about shouldering the immense technical obligations required to achieve HIPAA compliance.

## Going for the Gold: Proving HIPAA Compliance with the Gold Standard, HITRUST

With the HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF) Certification, we have proof the Datica Platform meets the “gold standard” of industry expectations. [HITRUST CSF Certification](https://datica.com/discover/hitrust/) remains an important designation for any organization developing digital health products that handle sensitive PHI. It combines different legislative initiatives that may be similar and yet somewhat contradictory to each other. The CSF provides one set of prescriptive controls from which everyone can work.

Customers inherit our security but, more importantly, they inherit our [HITRUST CSF certification](https://datica.com/blog/5-steps-to-hitrust-csf-certification/). Datica has been a leading voice in shaping what HITRUST looks like in the cloud and the fact that we just received our HITRUST CSF certification for the third time gives industry validation to our approach.

This latest CSF Certification is even more comprehensive [than the last](https://datica.com/platform/compliance/) since it also includes both the Azure and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) portions of [Datica’s platform](https://datica.com/platform/). With this certification extended to additional components of our platform, we now offer customers greater flexibility with cloud infrastructure choices.
