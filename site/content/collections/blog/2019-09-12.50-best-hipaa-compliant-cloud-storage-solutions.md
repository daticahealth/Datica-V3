For healthcare providers and related organizations, though, it’s a bit more complicated. Healthcare providers and other businesses that handle sensitive personal health information (PHI) must [comply with strict regulations](https://datica.com/blog/what-are-the-hipaa-cloud compliance-options-for-healthcare/) such as the [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act](https://datica.com/guide/hipaa/) (HIPAA) when storing, collecting, or transmitting PHI. If you want to store your sensitive data in the cloud, the solution you choose must sign a [Business Associate Agreement](https://datica.com/academy/business-associate-agreements/) (BAA) – a document that lays out its compliance with all HIPAA regulations, providing assurance that the company will appropriately safeguard all PHI it creates or receives on your organization’s behalf. 

Since there are so many options on the market, we’ve created a list of the 50 best HIPAA-compliant cloud storage solutions to help you find the best solution with the functionality and features your business needs. While features and pricing vary, the options listed here make cloud storage a breeze, even for companies that must comply with HIPAA. [AWS Backup](https://aws.amazon.com/backup/), for instance, makes it incredibly easy to automate and centralize the backup of data across all AWS services in the cloud and on-premise using the [AWS Storage Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/). AWS provides several HIPAA-compliant cloud storage solution services covered by their BAA, and you can view the complete list [here](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-eligible-services-reference/) – including non-storage services. 

*__Disclaimer:__ At Datica, we don’t fully endorse any company that claims to be HIPAA compliant without having the HITRUST CSF certification to prove it. When selecting cloud storage solutions, be sure to do due diligence when researching and evaluating your options.*

Please note that the following cloud storage solutions are organized alphabetically and are not rated or ranked in any way.
