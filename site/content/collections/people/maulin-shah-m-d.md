  Dr. Maulin Shah is Chief Informatics Engineer for Providence St. Joseph Health
  (PSJH), the second largest non-profit health system in America, where he
  focuses on maximizing the value of their EHR through optimization and
  innovation.


  He previously served as Medical Director for their Epic implementation project
  across 26 hospitals and 400 clinics.


  Dr. Shah completed medical school and residency at Baylor College of Medicine
  and then served as an Assistant Professor and Associate Program Director for
  the residency program. Maulin was a practicing hospitalist for 14 years and a
  Medical Director of his 50-physician group.


  Maulin is always a pioneer and always ahead of the curve. He founded
  PatientKeeper in 1998 – a company focused on mobilizing medical information
  even before anyone had dreamt of a smartphone.


  When he is not working, Maulin enjoys spending time with his wife and two
  teenage children, singing and playing guitar, and most recently researching
  nutrition and metabolism to improve his own health and that of his family and
  friends. While we can’t speak to his culinary or musical skills, we can attest
  that he’s a smart guy who can often see around the next two corners and knows
  how to get things done.
