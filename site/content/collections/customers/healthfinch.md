customer_story_short: 'Companies that recognize and address clinician’s workflow challenges will quickly rise to the top. Madison-based digital health vendor healthfinch studies these problems closely.'
customer_story_long: |
  If a physician or nurse must open an application outside of the electronic health record to access the company’s information technology, things will end there. As a result, healthfinch has made the EHR user experience one of its company focuses. Placing its technology within the EHR remains critical to the adoption and success of all the healthfinch products.
  
  The company’s Practice Automation Platform, Charlie, handles routine and repeatable clinical work for healthcare workers and physicians. Doctors say that these mundane tasks are one of the chief reasons for burnout, so embedding this technology into the EHR has become even more important.
  
  With a goal of dramatically impacting healthcare delivery, healthfinch first customized a non-standard interface to connect their technology with health systems. As the company scaled and moved toward a more defined structure to move data from point A to point B, instead of custom coding, healthfinch sought integration expertise from Catalyze. This case study lays out three important considerations healthfinch evaluated and are applicable to other IT teams when weighing “build versus buy” options for EHR integrations.
