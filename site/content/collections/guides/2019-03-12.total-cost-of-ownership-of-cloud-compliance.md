To build or buy your own solution is an important decision. Learn the estimated cost to build your own cloud compliance solution and all that goes into it. 
There’s much to know about both compliance and cloud management and that
knowledge requires a significant investment in time, education, personnel, and
money. This guide will help makers of digital health products make informed
decisions about whether to “build” cloud compliance themselves, or “buy” it in
the form of the Datica products.

This TCO guide explains the considerations of compliance and cloud management
in healthcare today and offers a framework to understand the activities,
resources, and cost estimates for each of those considerations. These
estimates are based on our extensive experience working with multiple
third-party auditors and multiple cloud infrastructure providers (like AWS and
Azure).


What's inside:


- Understanding compliance in the cloud 

- Architecting for HIPAA compliance in the cloud

- The importance of proving compliance with HITRUST 

- The total cost of ownership framework and estimates
