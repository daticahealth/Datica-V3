  To a nurse, greater efficiency means more time with patients. In today’s healthcare environment, technology and tools can help nurses coordinate patient care and the cacophony of alerts, alarms, and messages related to their care. But, achieving better efficiency is difficult without the right tools
  
  Spok knows that anything preventing nurses from responding to patient needs is a problem that needs attention. 
  
  Here’s how Spok solutions address nurses’ top concerns:
  
  - Minimize alarm fatigue by avoiding unnecessary alerts and messages
  - Deliver information directly from patient monitoring devices to a nurse’s mobile device
  - Coordinate communication quickly and effectively—helping nurses reach the right people on their team when they need them
