  ### The Challenge
  
  PipelineRx offers a combination of virtual pharmacist services (“telepharmacy”) and clinical pharmacy software that allows hospitals of all sizes to optimize pharmacy staffing and workflow to reduce labor costs and improve patient care. This also frees up more pharmacist resources to address high-value clinical services, such as patient discharge management and antimicrobial stewardship, and to round with care teams.
  
  Because hospital and health systems use various electronic health record (EHR) platforms and HL7 technology, PipelineRx’s virtual pharmacists were frequently juggling five or more windows on a single monitor as they reviewed and verified medication orders from different facilities. In order to get the data needed, telepharmacists also had to access native files, take screenshots, attach spreadsheets, and copy the data into the EHR, as required by state laws. This caused repetitive tasks and an inefficient use of the pharmacist’s time, in addition to the potential for inadvertent errors. 
  
  In order to make their SaaS-based solution work seamlessly, PipelineRx needed a partner that could enable them to pull in unverified pharmacy data and verify it in their platform  for easy access.
  
  ### Solution
  
  PipelineRx deployed Datica Integrate, Datica’s any-to-any data integration solution to enhance its software solution and better serve their hospital and health system customers. Using application programming interfaces (APIs), Datica Integrate removes interoperability barriers by enabling health data integration from any source to any destination, in any format. 
  
  Datica’s Integrate solution allows for seamless and secure integration and provides the flexibility to pull medication orders entered by the physician – including both structured and unstructured data. In addition, it enables streamlined, automated and efficient workflow for labor-intensive administrative functions.
  
  Working with PipelineRx, Datica’s integration team was able to quickly customize and deploy Datica Integrate to enhance the performance of their pharmacy platform.
   
  “We looked at many vendors that offered interface engines, but Datica had the experience working with various EHR platforms,” said Sean Parsons, Senior Solutions Architect at PipelineRx. “Datica Integrate appealed to us because it’s quick and easy to integrate with our software and allows us to obtain the unverified order information from EHRs, which is the key to providing health systems with an effective telepharmacy solution.”
  
  ### Results
  
  With Datica Integrate capturing EHR data in real-time, PipelineRx’s virtual pharmacists can work from just one or two open windows   to serve the needs of several facilities simultaneously as they review and verify orders or manage other clinical activities.
  
  The solution securely retrieves medication orders and encounters every two minutes, providing pharmacists with critical information about patient allergies, care provider observations, lab results and more. With Datica’s APIs supporting its software, PipelineRx’s telepharmacists can deliver faster turnaround times and better identify potential interventions.  
  “The reliability of EHR data is critical, and we can now count on getting the information required for each order,” said Eric Carter, Vice President of Integration at PipelineRx. “Pharmacists see the information electronically and the platform itself makes the data more timely.”
  This functionality is now extended to health systems that utilize the PipelineRx’s technology platform to virtually centralize their own pharmacy staff and/or extend services into the community or other nearby hospitals. “Interoperability between systems is the next logical evolution in hospital IT,” says Brian Roberts, CEO of PipelineRx. “This is a game changer in getting true medication management to the next level, managing transitions of care and working across care settings.”
