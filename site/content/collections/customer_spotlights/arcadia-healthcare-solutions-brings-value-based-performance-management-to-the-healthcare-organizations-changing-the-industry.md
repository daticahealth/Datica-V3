  ## A Strategic Pivot
  
  [Arcadia](http://arcadiasolutions.com) was founded in 2002 as a consulting firm primarily focused on insurers. Their specialty was systems integration throughout their first five years of existence.
  
  Eventually in 2008 they started working on more tooling for a mix of health systems, independent provider groups and health plans, which lead to version 1.0 of the Arcadia Analytics platform. They built a deep expertise in Electronic Health Record (EHR) and claims data integration and supporting technology. That led to a conscious pivot in 2012 to a technology-first, SaaS-based analytics company.
  
  And they haven't looked back since. Arcadia augmented their analytics technology strengths with two acquisitions in 2011 and 2015 to build [EHR infrastructure](http://www.arcadiasolutions.com/announcing-arcadias-acquisition-of-concordant/) and [managed care capabilities](http://www.arcadiasolutions.com/arcadia-acquires-sage/). Arcadia now connects 18 of the top 20 EHR platforms, have hundreds of live connections updated nightly, and work with premier health systems, health plans, and accountable care organizations across the country.

  ## The Right Mix of Experience and Progressiveness
  
  Arcadia believes their unique perspective gives them an advantageous position. Many of the health tech companies from the early 2000s are now gone, from either poor business models or dried up federal funding as Meaningful Use phases out. Meanwhile, venture capital has committed the highest amount of investment into startups the industry has seen in over a decade, leading to a surplus of small companies with big ambitions but little experience.
  
  With 20 years of experience, Arcadia has seen the many phases of healthcare technology and have a trusted veteran viewpoint, yet pride themselves on a commitment to the state of the art in technology and user experience.
  
  “We are a technology-first organization, but with the healthcare expertise to make that technology work in the real workflow of a provider office. A big reason for our trusted partnership is our commitment to usable technology,” said Chittim.

  ## Finding Meaning in Data
  
  One of the greatest challenges still in front of healthcare is finding meaning in the data that it is creating. As Arcadia steps in to build strong connectors in the absence of standards, they see an opportunity to help make sense of the data it is connecting.
  
  "To do real population health, you need significant connectivity both in the number of sources, the depth of information from those sources, and the quality of data you are integration," said Chittim. "We see ourselves as solving system-level problems at connecting and interpreting data, which will help our clients achieve the national imperative for higher quality, lower cost patient care."
