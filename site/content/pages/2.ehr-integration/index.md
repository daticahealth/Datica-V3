      Digital health requires data liquidity. Your application can’t deliver its  full value without it. Datica is here to help you unlock that potential and get to market quickly.
      
      Modern times call for modern measures. That’s why we created Datica Integrate, our comprehensive application programming interface (API) solution that enables data exchange in any format, across EHRs. With Datica Integrate, you are up and running within days, allowing you focus on your product – not on the integration. 
      
      Datica Integrate is also a fully compliant application solution that alleviates the frustrating hardships of working with standards-based interoperability, such as HL7v2 or FHIR.
