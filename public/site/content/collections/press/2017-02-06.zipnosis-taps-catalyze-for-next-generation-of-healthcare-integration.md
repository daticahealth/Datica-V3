### Virtual care pioneering company scales up on Catalyze’s HIPAA-compliant platform to offer HL7 integration to customers.

Madison, WI (PRWEB) June 02, 2015

[Catalyze™, Inc.](https://catalyze.io), a leading HIPAA-compliant platform provider that ignites and hastens development of healthcare technology, today announced an HL7 integration collaboration with [Zipnosis™](http://www.zipnosis.com). The Minneapolis-based company provides 24/7 online diagnosis and treatment service for common medical problems. Since HL7 integration is a core business strategy for Zipnosis, the company chose Catalyze because it shared a common vision on what the next generation of healthcare integration will be.

Zipnosis’ Director of Engineering, Derek Rockwell, said, “We’ve been working with Catalyze for over a year and during that time we have talked about the company’s vision for EHR integrations; it’s almost lockstep with our own, so we consider Catalyze a sister company in our long term endeavor.” Catalyze Chief Data Officer, Mark Olschesky, explained how that shared vision helps healthcare tech companies with integration, ”Secure data exchange goes hand in hand with secure data storage. We are able to help our customers enhance their products by offering out of the box, secure and repeatable integrations. Companies can supercharge growth and save hospitals valuable FTE time and improve patient safety by reducing double documentation.”

Rockwell stated that Zipnosis, like other companies looking to setup HL7 integrations, needs to be able to setup multiple VPN connections as a prerequisite to EHR integration. “It was an architectural decision to rely on Catalyze to manage VPN connections because they become an external verifier.” Due to company growth, Zipnosis realized it would need to set up more than one HL7 integration, so tapping Catalyze for its integration expertise made sense. “The Catalyze integration gives us a certain level of control and allows us to scale integrations out to more clients over time -- all faster than we could do ourselves,” shared Rockwell. He also underscored the technical team now worries less about the day to day maintenance of HL7 messages transmission. Said Rockwell, “We now have reliability, security and the Catalyze expertise behind it all.”

Mohan Balachandran, president and co-founder of Catalyze, believes accelerating HL7 integrations for health tech companies will be a major factor in transforming healthcare. “Catalyze enjoys working hand-in-hand with innovative companies like Zipnosis. We believe they hold the key to transforming traditional care.”
