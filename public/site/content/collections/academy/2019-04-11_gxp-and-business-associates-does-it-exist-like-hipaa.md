  A Business Associate is a vendor who works with a Covered Entity within the
  terms set forth by HIPAA. A [Business Associate
  Agreement](https://datica.com/blog/3-common-misconceptions-about-business-associate-agreements/),
  or BAA, is the contract between parties who handle Protected Health
  Information, or PHI.


  The intent of a BAA is to outline ownership of risk and liability as defined
  by HIPAA. A chain of risk is then created as BAs sign BAAs with other
  Subcontractor BAs.

GxP does not have the concept or BAAs or contracts that outline risk. There is no concept of inheritance or chaining liability.

The reason stems from a topic we discussed in [our GxP primer](https://datica.com/academy/what-is-gxp/): GxP isn't a government regulation with defined vocabulary or mandated procedures, like [HIPAA](https://datica.com/discover/hipaa-compliance/) or [GDPR](https://datica.com/discover/gdpr/). Instead, GxP is an industry-accepted understanding of NIST standards adopted by the FDA in [CFR Title 21 Chapter 11](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/compliance/fda).

Nowhere are BAAs or other contracts outlined. There is no risk passed down via GxP.

Instead, when a cloud service provider, like Datica, claims GxP compliance, they are claiming that they have been audited against the interpretations of FDA guidelines. Whatever relationships that business has with its partners — like Datica with AWS or Microsoft Azure — is immaterial. For example, a customer of Datica is only concerned if Datica itself is GxP compliant; contrast this to HIPAA, where a customer of Datica is also concerned what BAA inheritance Datica has with its partners.
