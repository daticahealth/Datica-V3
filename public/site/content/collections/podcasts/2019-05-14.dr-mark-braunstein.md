  Today Healthcare Innovators Podcast has a great conversation about "Healthcare
  in the Age of Interoperability" with Dr. Mark Braunstein, who teaches
  healthcare informatics at Georgia Tech. In this episode, Travis Good, MD finds
  out more about Braunstein and his work at the first US university to have a
  FHIR server for class work. Listeners will learn more about the FHIR-enabled
  projects that Georgia Tech master-level students are doing in conjunction with
  research physician clinicians in the Atlanta area.


  We also prod Braunstein for his personal insight about what is missing in
  today’s medical education. Listeners can gain deeper insight into this area,
  by ordering Braunstein’s latest book "[Practitioner’s Guide to Health
  Informatics](https://www.amazon.com/Practitioners-Guide-Health-Informatics-Braunstein/dp/3319176617)."

key_takeaways: >-
  1. Learn what’s driving the adoption of FHIR

  2. Discover what is prompting explosive interest in Braunstein’s healthcare
  informatics courses

  3. Get the inside scoop on what Georgia Tech students are creating with the
  FHIR standard and access to local clinician researchers

  4. Explore the three areas that FHIR does not currently address or solve
---
**On the latest interest in health information exchange:** "I’ve been in this field since 1970 and there have been "boomlets" around health information exchange. And they've all turned out to be just that -- "boomlets." I may live to eat these words, . . . but it really seems real this time."

"I think [Grahame Grieve](/innovation/grahame-grieve-pt1)'s genius, the author behind FHIR, was to recognize that, to use an expression: *Perfect is the enemy of good*. He is developing the standard according to a practical set of guidelines that quite intentionally isn't going to lead to a standard that solves all problems, but will relatively lead to a standard that solves the most common use cases."

**On why FHIR is garnering academic interest:** "By providing what might be a universal platform, the door is open to innovation. I developed a relatively unique approach to teaching health informatics at Georgia Tech. We've created our own FHIR server that stores quite a bit of synthetic or public data sets."

"To me, that's the most exciting thing about interoperability, at least as it creates an open, universal app platform. We’ve needed innovation in this field for a long, long time. I should also mention the fact that it is all based on widely used web technologies. That makes it very attractive to young people."

**On patient-generated data and FHIR:** "I think in time, those data streams are all going to be based in FHIR, but that remains to be seen."

"Why can’t a blood pressure cuff emit the appropriate FHIR observation resource? Why can't a glucometer do the same for glucose levels? I think we are going to get to that in time, although it is going to take time."
