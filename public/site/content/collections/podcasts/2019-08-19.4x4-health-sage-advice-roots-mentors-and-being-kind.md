  **Dr. Levin:** Welcome to 4x4 Health sponsored by Datica. Datica; Bringing
  health care to the cloud. Check them out at www.datica.com. I’m your host Dr.
  Dave Levin. One of my favorite parts of 4x4 Health is when our guests offer
  their most sage advice. It’s been fascinating and enlightening to hear the
  wide range of responses on this open-ended question. Some guests offer sage
  advice about work others about life. They’re consistently wise and [unclear].
  As part of our summer hiatus we’re revisiting some of this great wisdom. We
  hope you find these sage mashups as inspiring as we do. 


  My good friends Dr. Maulin Shah and Dr. David Butler helped us kick off the
  4x4 Health podcast by being our first two guests. Later in the season Justin
  Adams joined us to talk about practical applications of AI. Maulin, Dave, and
  Justin had some truly sage advice about doing great work and developing your
  full capacity as a leader and as a human being. 


  Maulin is Chief Informatics Engineer for Providence St. Joseph Health, the
  second largest non-profit health system in America, where he focuses on
  maximizing the value of EHR through optimization and innovation. He’s also
  increasingly involved in the world of health IT start-ups. 



  **Dr. Levin:** Let’s wrap up and Maulin take us home by giving us your most
  sage advice.


  **Dr. Maulin:** Well I save it never forgetting your roots is an important
  thing no matter who you are and where you are, and in informatics and in my
  career it means not forgetting what it’s like to be a practicing physician on
  the line, taking care of a second crashing patient in the ICU, knowing what
  the stresses are really like and staying clinically relevant, I quit my
  practice about two years ago because I just couldn’t keep doing both. But
  staying in the hospital, staying in the clinic, staying on the side of our
  clinicians so that we’re in their service, we’re the service of our patients,
  we’re in the service of our clinicians and not forgetting that and kind of
  getting lost in technology or getting lost in some grand scheme of patient
  quality improvement that doesn’t have any basis in reality is to curb it all.


  **Dr. Levin:** Well I think that’s beautiful, if I could build on that I would
  add remember what it’s like to be a patient or to have a love right as a
  patient as well. And like you I think it provides the mission and the work and
  it provides grounding as you make what are often very difficult decisions
  where there’s no clear right answer, and I have also found that for my IT
  colleagues it really helps to connect them to the meaning and importance of
  their work as well, so I think that’s wonderfully sage advice.

  **Dr. Levin:** Next up is David Butler, founder and Principal of Calyx
  Consulting. David is a well-known health IT leader with deep expertise in
  deploying and utilizing information technology. His consulting firm focuses
  solely on EHR post-live efficiency training, EHR optimization, and strategic
  planning for clients like NYC Health and Hospitals, Guthrie Clinic, and the
  Cleveland Clinic. 


  I asked Dave the sage advice question too, but before I did, knowing that he
  and I can get carried away sometimes, I reminded him that 4x4 Health is a
  family show … 


  --

  **Dr. Levin:** Okay, Dave. So last question. What is your most sage advice?


  **Dr. Butler:** Okay, this will be quick. I found my sage advice to folks that
  I run into a lot, a lot of positions or email me because they may be wanting
  to try something different outside of the normal traditional patient encounter
  type thing or a young folks, oh it’s coming up thinking about med school,
  residency informatics and they’ll call me. So I think the number one thing I
  tell them now is find a mentor. Look around, find anyone out there that’s
  doing what you think you might want to do and un-bill yourself enough to make
  a call. Call on three or four or five time bugged the heck out of them. Just
  say, Hey, I don’t want anything from you. I just want to know if we can maybe
  spend an hour every two months where I just update you on what I’m doing. And
  then you just tell me what you see and what you hear as far as what I’m
  saying. And, and helped me to get to be like, yeah, I don’t know to be like
  you even, you know. So these are things that I just had to learn and some of
  them, they weren’t always doctors. And also I had to learn like the mentor
  should be someone, then maybe I have a financial mentor, I have a spiritual
  mentor, you know, they don’t have to be the same person, you know? And so I
  think mentorship is so important and making time to get that mentorship is
  this invaluable, you know? And I think that’s my sage advice. And last thing
  is just always placed learnings before earnings, right? So many folks just
  want to, well, I can’t take a pay cut like that, or I can’t do this or I can’t
  do that. I hadn’t even heard students, even my own daughter, you know,
  sometimes their son, they may, they may frown upon doing things for free. A
  minimum amount of money, right? Building a website for someone you know, for,
  you know, just volunteering too. And you know, he’s computer science or
  whatever. I’m like, well, you playing Fortnight right now, uh, I’m about to
  build a website. Well, I’m just a good experience. You know? He’s like, oh,
  that makes sense. They don’t always think like that. Right. I think those are
  some things I really encouraged now with doctors, I say volunteer on a
  technology committee or something and that may cost you a little time in the
  evening, but I think you’ll realize over the long game it’s definitely, yeah,
  payback in 20s.


  **Dr. Levin:** Well, Dave, this is why you’re such a terrific and well
  recognized leader in healthcare and health IT, I mean so much of what you said
  today are the basic elements of the servant leader. You surround yourself with
  smart people and you engage them and empower them. You ask a lot of questions,
  you think about governance and not what, not just what needs to be done, but
  how should it be done? You’re, you’re encouraging of people to use mentors and
  to focus on learning. Couldn’t agree more. I’m a, I’m a huge fan of mentors.
  I’m a huge fan of executive coaching. I’m a huge fan of formal cultural work
  in organizations. You’re singing all of my favorite tunes, that’s for sure.
  I’ll that I’ll never forget. I was contemplating a really terrific job offer.
  It was a big leap for me. And I went to one of my mentors and of course I’m a
  southern boy and he was a grizzled old southern gentleman, uh, who had advised
  me many times over the years. And he looked at me, said, well Dave, you did
  pretty good plan and the junior varsity is a chance for you to play for the
  varsity. And I knew at that moment, I knew at that moment what he was trying
  to tell me and what I should do. So I couldn’t agree more about mentors. Dave,
  thanks so much for talking with us today.


  **Dr. Butler:** Yeah, no, this was great. I’m honored that you asked me to be
  on your show or your podcast. I know this is a new venture here. I’m excited.
  You know, once again, this is, this is what is needed, this kind of dialogue
  that happens outside of some of the normal areas of this healthcare
  informatics. So I’m all about it, Dave.



  **Dr. Levin** Our final sage advice today comes from Justin Adams, co-founder
  and CEO of Digitize.AI. Justin and his team are using artificial intelligence
  to transform how healthcare is administered by applying it to common processes
  like insurance preauthorization. Justin has more than a decade working with
  artificial intelligence and automation and has also worked in the intelligence
  community. His sage advice really struck home with me. 



  **Dr. Levin:** What’s your most sage advice for us?


  **Justin:** So, my most sage advice is pretty simple but to be kind. So, I
  think there’s way too much animosity in our society right now and I think
  businesses and startup leaders have a responsibility to create an
  organizational culture of kindness. I’ve been fortunate enough in my career to
  work with and for some a wide variety of leaders including Four-Star Generals
  to Fortune 50 CEOs but also in that mix of this include some world class jerks
  and never once were those jerks more effective leaders than the ones who were
  kind. So, you know in addition to being kind you know, having that be the
  right thing to do, I think it also makes the most business sense. So, if you
  believe like I do that human capital and high functioning teams are the
  biggest competitive advantage your organization can have, it just makes the
  most sense. So, I’ve seen plenty of unsuccessful teams that were as sound
  technically or hire better ideas as any other but the didn’t trust each other
  and ultimately didn’t succeed. So, if you look at the root cause of that I
  think  it really comes down to a lack of trust and cynicism and too often I
  think organizations make success of zero sum game for their team and so I’m a
  huge believer in the rising tide lifting and all those are digitizes, three
  core values or trust transparency and courage and those are the things that we
  really try to live out. So, certainly being kind to one another and being kind
  to all the people that we interact with I think is again, simple but sage
  advice.


  **Dr. Levin:** Well, that’s just really terrific and definitely makes my heart
  sing. I could not agree more that not only is it the right thing to do but
  it’s god business and I would highly encourage our listeners to check out the
  work done under the title firms of endearment, for our hard data that shows
  that companies and individuals that behave this way towards their colleagues,
  towards their customers, towards their competitors, outperform the SNP-500,
  outperform the good great companies. It’s fascinating work and you know, the
  other thing for me is we spend a lot of time at work and so to have that be an
  environment, that’s encouraging and nurturing and just a nice place to be. I
  think it’s just important to life in general. Now, it’s called work for a
  reason, right. 

  Justin, it’s not play, it’s work but the way we approach, it can make a huge
  difference. So boy, I really appreciate and admire your sage advice.



  **Dr. Levin** Never forget your roots and stay close to the work. Cultivate
  all kinds of mentors. Be kind. Sage advice indeed if you want to really
  understand how to deliver great solutions, and develop your full potential as
  a leader and as a person. 

  Thank you to Maulin, Dave, and Justin for sharing this advice.
