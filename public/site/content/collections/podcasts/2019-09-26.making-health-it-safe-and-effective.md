  **Dr. Levin:** Welcome to 4x4 Health sponsored by Datica. Datica; Bringing
  health care to the cloud. Check them out at www.datica.com. I'm your host Dr.
  Dave Levin. This week we continue our exploration of safety and reliability
  with a deeper dive into the issue of safer health information technology with
  our guest Ben Cooperman; senior associate at health care performance
  improvement or HPI. HPI is a Press Ganeys company that offers consulting
  services to organizations seeking to improve human performance in complex
  systems using evidence based methods from high reliability organizations. With
  over 10 years of experience in health care technology and safety, Ben brings a
  wealth of experience and knowledge to engagements with leading health care
  organizations such as M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and the Mayo Clinic. Today
  on 4x4 health he shares his insights into building safer, more reliable and
  more effective health information systems and how putting safety first is
  increasingly a winning strategy. Welcome to Four by four health Ben.


  **Mr. Cooperman:** Thanks Dave. Happy to be here.


  **Dr. Levin:** I'm going to ask you a series of four questions today and will
  take about four minutes to answer each one. To get us started tell us a bit
  more about yourself and your organization.


  **Mr. Cooperman:** Sure. So as you mentioned I'm a senior associate with
  health care performance improvement or HPI for short. We are a Press Ganey
  solution. What we do is we work with health care organizations, namely
  hospitals, hospital systems and physician groups and we facilitate their
  journey to high reliability and we bring high reliability organizing
  principles to those organizations. My background is slightly different than
  some of my colleagues. We do have a multidisciplinary group. We've got a
  number of folks coming from health care directly, physicians nurses and health
  care administrators. We have a number of folks coming from the nuclear power
  industry and we also have some folks coming from naval aviation. But as you
  mentioned my background is a little different on those folks and that I come
  with a health care technology background. So I spent a majority of my career
  working in the technology space, but solely focused on health care as it
  pertains to hospitals, hospital systems and our delivery of care here in the
  United States. And my focus was always around the EMR and other technology
  that we would use in health care. So it's a little bit about myself and who we
  are at HPI.


  **Dr. Levin:** Well Iâ€™ve definitely got a I want to get deeper into what
  you've observed particularly around their use of technology like EHR. But
  before we go deep on this let's talk about a couple of general concepts. So
  several times you've used the word reliability and high reliability
  organizations. Take a moment and help us understand the connection between
  reliability and safety and exactly what is a high reliability organization and
  why should we care?


  **Mr. Cooperman:** Yes sure that's a great question. So oftentimes we'll use a
  definition from [unclear] Managing the Unexpected about what a high
  reliability organization is or what highly reliable organizing is and that's
  an organization that operates under very trying conditions all the time yet
  manages to have fewer than their fair share of accidents. So it's pretty
  canned response but when you put an image in your mind. A lot of these
  principles and practices stem out of some typical industries that are
  considered age arose, such as nuclear power and naval aviation. Now these
  organizations as you can imagine operate in very trying conditions as we
  mentioned. So think about an aircraft carrier. What does that mean? Well we've
  got a lot of jets landing and taking off from an aircraft carrier and a lot of
  sailors trying to stay safe in a pretty complex environment on that ship. But
  we don't hear about those jets crashing all that frequently, it's pretty rare.
  So we consider that an HRO. They have fewer than their fair share of accidents
  if you will. So what does that mean in health care? How do we translate that
  to health care? I think in healthcare we operate in a very trying environment
  all the time. We have a lot of very sick patients coming to us with grave
  illnesses or some pretty significant injuries. But how are we working to stay
  safe? How are we working to keep our patients safe and ourselves safe as well.
  So that's a little bit about it. HRO as we say a lot of times have five
  characteristics. So we talk about a preoccupation with failure, sensitivity to
  operations, a reluctance to simplify interpretations and then we talk about a
  commitment to resilience and a deference to expertise and how those five
  traits apply to the work that an HRO will do, we bring those five traits as
  well as many other principles and behaviors into health care.


  **Dr. Levin:** Well this to me makes a lot of common sense from the standpoint
  of these are entities, organizations, industries that can reliably perform at
  a high level and do so safely. And the other thing that I have found to be
  appealing over the years is this notion of health care as another one of these
  industries. It makes sense conceptually and I think it also it resonates with
  people who work in health care, who can see themselves in that kind of an
  industry. You know as we've talked about with your colleague Craig Clapper,
  culture and the way we receive this information is a critical component of
  reliability as well. And so both these metaphors of whether it's aerospace or
  nuclear power, I think those resonate with people in health care and they also
  provide a really useful frame very often for thinking about the issues
  specific to health care.


  **Mr. Cooperman:** Yeah. You know I think when we go out to organizations one
  of the first impressions that some of our folks that we work with are that
  it's kind of refreshing. They've realized that they work in a high risk, high
  consequence environment. They realize that the work they do is dangerous and
  there's harm that does occur, but they didn't always know what to do. They
  didn't always know how to frame it, how to classify it and then what to do
  about it and try to remove it from healthcare. There's been a lot of work
  around process improvement in health care and we try to tackle maybe one type
  of harm at a time, say [unclear] or things like that, but it hasn't been
  holistic in nature so we're very limited in our focus. And when folks see the
  high reliability principles and sort of what we start talking about, it's kind
  of refreshing in nature. It gives you a path, it gives you a guiding framework
  to move to try to remove that harm from health care that people see but don't
  always know what to do about it.


  **Dr. Levin:** So let's pick up that lead and go a little deeper specifically
  around these issues as they apply to technology and health care and
  particularly information systems and information technology. What are some of
  the general principles that you've observed that map to Health IT. What's
  worked and then we'll get into what are some other challenges as well.


  **Mr. Cooperman:** Yeah sure. So the first step I think a lot of times is just
  defining what we're talking about. So we have this word Iatrogenicharm or
  Iatrogenisis, it's been coined in an article. I think that comes from around
  2007. Some folks were trying to put a label on what this really means and the
  definition we have of that is patient harm caused at least in part by
  application of health information technology. So over the years as our
  technology around us has improved and gotten far more advanced, just as it has
  in our personal lives, think of where we were say 10 or even 15 years ago with
  technology in our personal lives it's advanced greatly. It's the same thing in
  health care. We've advanced greatly with our technology with the
  implementation of electronic medical records and all these other pieces of
  technology that we use in our delivery of care. But as it's become more
  advanced it's also become more complex and as part of that we are experiencing
  harm that's caused as a result of our technology. So what does this really
  mean for us? Well thinking about those HRO principles, oftentimes we don't
  always have that when we're thinking about HIT, healthcare information
  technology HIT for short. HIT in my mind will encompass all this different
  technology that we use, not just the electronic medical record or the
  electronic health record. We have all these different definitions and
  different names of different technology. We've got a lot of it. So what are
  some of these principles really mean to us? Well do we have a preoccupation
  with failure. So I don't know that we're always preoccupied with how something
  can go wrong when we implement this technology in health care. I think we do
  to an extent, but we're not hyper aware of it. We think about all the great
  things this technology can do, how it can really help us in providing care
  help our patients and that's what we think about. We think about the positive,
  which is great in one respect. But we're not always hyper aware of what can go
  wrong when we implement this technology. We maybe have a couple plans in
  place, but that's not the forefront of our mind. Not what can go wrong. It's
  always how great this is. So we don't always do that. I would say that should
  be something we should start thinking about a little bit more as we bring more
  and more technology to health care. Thatâ€™s one example Dave.


  **Dr. Levin:** Okay Ben I'm here jumping back and forth on one foot. I got to
  get a couple things in edgewise. I mean that just packed a real punch and I
  want to unpack just a couple of things. So first this term Iatrogenisis. This
  is an old medical term and essentially it's you know any harm caused
  inadvertently by medical care. And what you have done as you've pointed out,
  we've appended the letter E as we often do for modern times to make the point
  that Iatrogenic harm can come in many different ways, in this case it's caused
  by our electronic health information systems. The other thing that you said
  that just kind of let me up here for a moment was and I know you're going to
  walk us through other guiding principles. But as you take them off it just
  triggers frankly memories, maybe a little bit of PTSD in myself having these
  systems and I immediately thought of an example from the bad old days that
  involved implementing a forcing function around some ordering. So there were
  some orderable and some well-intended folks put in place a forcing function
  where you had to answer and take certain steps in order to get a medication
  dispensed. And it worked fine in the routine setting, but it turned out to be
  disastrous during a code blue. So I think that maybe is a sort of example of
  where we think about these things in health IT design, but we don't always as
  you say preoccupy our self with failure and that it can present itself in the
  real world later.


  **Mr. Cooperman:** Yeah I think you bring up a good point there. Not
  necessarily your PTSD because I can certainly speak to that myself. But I
  think this is a good example of maybe we weren't completely preoccupied with
  failure here. Kind of in the early days we thought this would be a great idea.
  We're going to add a forcing function around ordering this medication. We
  talked to our folks down in pharmacy, we talked to some of the physicians and
  other clinical folks, our nurses and we said you know it's really important
  that we have this one piece of information when ordering this drug. We're
  going to make this a required field and you always have to have it in order to
  order the medication. But we didn't think about all the different scenarios
  that would occur here. Specifically a code blue as you mentioned. Now we're in
  this situation, we've got a code blue. We really need this medication, we
  really need to place this order and now we're stuck at a screen, because we
  can't go forward in any way shape or form unless we fill out this field. And
  you and I both know Dave we don't have this information at this point in time,
  so where do we go? What do we do. We don't have the maybe NA, not applicable
  option. We put in false information just to get past the screen and then it
  brings us to this point well we're simply going to go around the system in
  some way shape or form, because it's not working for us. That's a perfect
  example of how we haven't implemented a preoccupation with failure in this.
  Maybe we didn't do enough testing, maybe we didn't get enough end users to the
  table when we were thinking about implementing this type of technology. This
  is where we come up with this preoccupation with failure is safety being
  talked about first. How is this going to fail around us and what are we going
  to do to mitigate those types of situations. Is that a topic of mind before we
  hit that go like button metaphorically speaking and yes as you mentioned,
  Iatrogenisis, It's kind of a mouthful at times and as you mentioned we sort of
  put E or I in front of something and all of a sudden it means technology these
  days. But you're right it's an old term meaning harm and we can call something
  like this Iatrogenic harm. Now we have a name for it. It's harm caused in part
  at least maybe completely by the technology that surrounds us and we want that
  technology to make us safer all the time and help us out. But these instances
  that we're talking about where it just goes the other direction for us.


  **Dr. Levin:** Well this is really great. Let's keep going. And perhaps you
  could give us one or two more examples of these general principles and how
  they might apply specifically to Health IT.


  **Mr. Cooperman:** Yeah sure. So another one that I like talking about
  frequently is deference to expertise. So this is when we've gotten ourselves
  in trouble, maybe we implemented a piece of technology it's not working out
  for us; deference to expertise. Are we calling in the person or the people
  that have the most related knowledge or the correct expertise at this point in
  time to help us out. Or are we relying on some other variable to identify
  who's going to help us. So do we pull rank. Okay this is a big situation here.
  We're going to pull in the highest person we can find. Maybe they have
  something like Chief in front of their job title something like that. But the
  reality of the situation is we might need somebody else. We weren't really
  deference to expertise there, we were going by some other variable. I don't
  always see this happening sometimes, it's the provider not too happy with the
  situation and they're going to go right to the top of the metaphorical food
  chain. But is that a deference to expertise, are we pulling in the right
  people at the right time or are we just going up the chain of command, because
  that's what we feel is necessary even though it's not the right direction to
  go.


  **Dr. Levin:** Ben I think you came on this show deliberately to press my hot
  buttons. Because you just had another one and Iâ€™ve talked about this in other
  settings before. The example I would give is even more basic than that, we go
  to design a new function or capability and we decide you know the frontline
  staff they're too busy. We'll get someone to be a proxy for them. That's fine,
  it's fine to have a proxy in the room. But they're just a proxy. And the
  reality is the way work is actually done at the frontline, at the sharp end of
  the spear if you will is often quite different than the way it's imagined by a
  manager or a director. There's a description in the book some way of what
  people are supposed to be doing. And then there's what actually happens on the
  frontline in the care of patients. And to me this is another example of where
  we don't have the right expertise in the room. So we design something that
  makes perfect sense if your understanding is theoretical. But all the sudden
  doesn't work very well in the real world when it meets real people and real
  culture. 


  **Mr. Cooperman:** Yes so what are we doing in actuality as opposed to what
  we're doing in theory or what we believe is happening at the frontline. So we
  somewhere up at the blunt end, on our blunt and sharp end model that you
  mentioned there a great reference, we at the blunt end have some idea of
  what's happening at the sharp end. But we don't actually go out there and
  solicit what is occurring in real life. We just believe what we want to
  believe. We don't pull in those folks working at the sharp end and say, hey
  how is this actually working for you and let's build that into our model. We
  just go with what our notions are. So I didn't purposely push your buttons but
  I'm kind of glad I did/ because it's a principle that we don't always live and
  breathe unfortunately.


  **Dr. Levin:** And it's also isn't it about the diversity and making sure that
  if you're working on a complex workflow that all the stakeholders involved in
  that work or at least in some way contributing to the analysis on the design,
  it's a team sport isn't it?


  **Mr. Cooperman:** Yeah I think you hit that. I mean those are the words that
  were in my head as you were talking right there. Health care used to be so top
  down in nature. But anymore our environment is so complex as you mentioned it
  is one hundred percent a team sport. Everyone has to work together and
  everyone has to be on the same page to move forward. Otherwise we're going to
  have these incidents of Iatrogenic harm as you and I are talking about quite a
  bit.


  **Dr. Levin:** All right well let's pick another one and let's see made I can
  avoid one of my minefields. But go ahead.


  **Mr. Cooperman:** Sure. So how about a commitment to resilience. So what do
  we do when we're in trouble again, What's our commitment to resilience. So do
  we have capabilities to detect contain and maybe bounce back from or events
  that do occur. Do we have those plans in place. So think about say downtime,
  how robust are our downtime procedures when our system goes down or systems
  plural go down. We may be have a rough plan in place, it's there. But is it
  taking into consideration as many possibilities as we can think of. And then
  to push it even further Dave, do we practice our downtime procedures.


  **Dr. Levin:** Yeah. Well again you're giving me bad flashbacks today. You
  know here's an example that Iâ€™ve see and still see occasionally is we don't
  plan for example, how are we going to write prescriptions for patients when
  the system is down either a scheduled down or an unplanned down and this is
  not meant as a criticism, but many young practicing physicians have literally
  never written out a prescription by hand. They've only ordered using a
  computer which is great when you can do it. But what happens when the system
  is down? You get into these really practical things like Do we have
  prescription pads and that even more practical- Does this individual have the
  training to know how to write out a prescription on paper, have they actually
  even had that experience much less so training to do it. I'm sure there are
  many many more sophisticated examples, but that's one that Iâ€™ve personally
  observed and Iâ€™ve observed repeatedly in these situations.


  **Mr. Cooperman:** Yeah it's a tough situation to be in. So unlike some other
  industries where we can take a step back and have one of those days where we
  can do some planning and health care, our stance is always that health care
  never stops as patients are always coming in the door. So we can't really take
  a step back and plan. But if weâ€™re creative, excuse me, in our thinking just
  quite a bit, I'm sure we can find scenarios where we can still practice what
  our say downtime procedures are in this specific instance as you mentioned,
  how do we write a prescription when prescribing is not working for us. Let's
  take some time and run through that and we'll start finding problems with our
  downtime procedure. Like it's written out. We've got great plans in place, but
  nobody's thought ahead to order some prescription pads because they're just
  not around anymore. We start finding out all these little details that we
  missed. So this is certainly another principle that we talk about in HRO that
  is applicable without a doubt to health care technology.


  **Dr. Levin:** This is really helpful. I feel like we have largely been
  talking about these issues from the standpoint of the clinical application of
  the technology. It's the doctor or nurse using one of these information
  systems to care for patients. I want to shift the focus a little bit and talk
  about this from the perspective of a member of the IT department. How might
  some of these principles apply very specifically to the practice of
  information technology rather than the practice of clinical medicine?


  **Mr. Cooperman:** Yeah. So let's think about another characteristic of an HRO
  and that's a sensitivity to operation. So we are health care IT workers, Dave
  you and I are at our health care IT desks in our office and we're doing our
  work diligently. But how sensitive are we to the operation that's going on. I
  think one of the problems we experience sometimes is that Dave you and I and
  our imaginary roles here, we are removed from health care delivery quite
  frequently. So I think this is a problem that is experienced across health
  care technology. Maybe we are trying to implement this. This characteristic; a
  sensitivity to operations. But we've got a lot of barriers in place. You and I
  Dave we may be sitting at our desks, we're 30 miles down the road from the
  nearest hospital. We're very much disconnected from health care. So we don't
  always have a feel of what's going on at the sharp end, because we're so far
  away from it. Now how can we bring that principle to these health care IT
  workers? Well I think we should get them involved with clinical operations.
  Even just a little bit. Maybe you have a kind of bring your health care IT
  employee to work type day kind of deal and we get out of our desks we see
  what's going on at the front line. This is certainly a way that you could take
  one of these HRO principles and put them in place from the health care IT
  perspective.


  **Dr. Levin:** Well you've hit another hot button on me, but this is a good
  one. This is a positive one. Yeah I very much believe in this and when I had
  the opportunity in roles where I could foster those kinds of relationships
  worked hard at it. I happen to think this goes both ways. What I discovered
  was that connecting my IT colleagues to the deeper meaning of the clinical
  work was inspiring to them, help them appreciate the important value of what
  they were doing. Its impact on health, its impact on their neighbors and their
  full citizens gave them a deeper understanding of some of the clinical
  challenges and workflow challenges. But the reverse was also true that as my
  clinical colleagues began to grasp the challenges that their IT colleagues
  faced, that deeper understanding led to better conversations and I think
  better decision making as well. So there's something on both sides of this. If
  you're just joining us you're listening to 4x4 Health and we're talking with
  Ben Cooperman; senior associate at HPI. The other thing that's just so
  interesting about what you're talking about here is this is a cultural
  activity. I think this begins to open the window on another important aspect
  of all of this. That what you experts refer to as the socio technical
  environment and the role that culture plays as an important underpinning in
  all of this. And the example that you and others have given me was Well we
  might have a checklist for example about an important process, say Iâ€™ve been
  working on some code and I'm going to now move that from testing into
  production and perhaps I have a checklist of activities that I'm supposed to
  go through. Just like a pre-flight checklist for a pilot. Well it's great to
  have the checklist, but if I'm not part of a culture where that's valued and
  the expectation is that I will consistently do it, then it's not clear it's
  going to have much of an impact. So a simple example, but is that a reasonable
  example of where culture and safe practices kind of meet in the creation of
  the actual environment we operate in.
   
  **Mr. Cooperman:** Absolutely and you touched on that word socio technical
  system where we have people processes and technology working together in
  concert every day. Now if we have that checklist that's all well and good.
  That's our process that we follow. That's a tool that we use to make sure that
  we're hitting all the steps along the process. But if our culture says well
  we're not very reliable in using the checklist or we're kind of lax in using
  the checklist, it's not really that important to us. Well we've just skirted
  around a tool that we've put into place to make sure that we don't have
  mistakes, a barrier to us experiencing adverse events if you will. And we
  really need to work on that culture and you mentioned that before with that
  teamwork. If we have our healthcare IT folks out understanding what's going on
  for our clinical folks and the same thing reversed, clinical folks
  understanding the challenges of our healthcare IT folks, we're going to
  increase that teamwork and we're going to start affecting the culture and our
  organization and our culture is one of those very strong behavior shaping
  traits at the blunt end from that model we mentioned before. 


  **Dr. Levin:** It's an interesting contrast to the idea of our forcing
  function. And your colleague Craig Clapper and I had this conversation
  recently and I referred to things like hard stops and other forcing functions.
  Which he acknowledged and he said you know culture is a choosing function. So
  to go back to my simple example, the checklist is there. It can be used as a
  kind of forcing function to check all these things. But if culturally I don't
  make the choice to use it, then it's of little value. I think this whole idea
  of socio technical environment resonates very deeply with those of us at work
  in the field. You as you might not be surprised to hear you are not the first
  person on this podcast to refer to what I call the Iron triad of people
  process and technology. And I don't know about you Ben but I have never seen a
  successful project that did not address all three and as you point out there
  is no reliability and no safety without addressing all three as well.


  **Mr. Cooperman:** Yeah as soon as you forget one of those three you're
  leading yourself down a path to disaster in my opinion and I think a lot of
  folks as you mentioned would probably agree with that. We need to address all
  three otherwise. Our chances of success are going to be pretty low in my
  opinion.


  **Dr. Levin:** Yeah. The other thing that I find really interesting about the
  way you and your colleagues talk about these subjects is you talk about their
  impact on all the human beings involved. So clearly in health care our primary
  mission is first do no harm. And that's about not harming patients. And we
  have to take that very very seriously of course. But what I also find
  appealing about this topic is, it's also about. How we care for each other,
  how we care for the health care providers, for the IT workers. For everyone
  engaged in what I consider to be a very sacred task, which is healing the
  community. Talk a little bit more about this aspect of it, its impact on
  people in general.


  **Mr. Cooperman:** Sure. So we talk about safety and safety first and safety
  for all. We don't come in and simply talk about let's just make sure our care
  for our patients is safe. We talk about safety in general being first in our
  decision making and we think about this sometimes in our daily life and we
  don't even realize it when you get on the airplane and they tell you to put
  the mask on first in an emergency before you help the person sitting next to
  you. If we're not safe, we can't provide safe care. So we need to worry about
  how safe we are as well and many of these principles and practices help us
  stay safe. Now health care is a very dangerous field to be working in,
  especially when you start looking at the numbers around it. It is very
  dangerous for us as employees. Some of that stuff is very obvious to us. I
  think our emergency departments these days when I'm going out there to our
  clients and talking to different individuals of these organizations, I hear it
  most loudly from our emergency department folks about the patient population
  coming in and how dangerous it is for them sometimes. But these people, these
  principles and processes and HRO tactics are for how safe we are as well how
  do we experience safety in our work every single day. 


  **Dr. Levin:** So you mentioned earlier in this discussion specifically the
  electronic health record and I think that bears scoring a little bit deeper. I
  imagine you agree with me that the widespread deployment this if you will the
  first phase of digitizing health care has been you know largely successful at
  least in terms of getting people to put down pen and paper and start using
  keyboards. But it has also introduced you know significant complexity to the
  socio technical environment. Tell us a little bit about some of the basic
  things you've observed and what you see is as kind of hope for the future if
  you will.


  **Mr. Cooperman:** So that's a great question. I think what Iâ€™ve seen and
  observed over the past decade is we did exactly as you mentioned. We decided
  it was time to put down the pens and the paper and use technology and health
  care and that was really stimulated by the government providing some funds for
  this and basically saying to hospitals, we're going to cut some of your
  reimbursements unless you hit some of these goals that we've put in place. We
  have a carrot and stick type deal here. But we haven't focused on say the
  human factors component of health care technology. It's out there, it's
  working for us. But isn't working really well for us. Well that's obviously a
  topic of debate. I think Dave you and I are probably on the same page. Just a
  hunch here that we're experiencing a lot of pain and health care.
  Metaphorically speaking with the technology, it's not always working that well
  for us. It's doing some of those basic functions as you mentioned. It's taking
  away the pen and the paper. It's digitized what we're doing, but have we
  really reinvented or transformed the way we deliver care with technology
  involved in it. I would argue that we have not. And that's what I'd like to
  see in the future. That's my vision for the future is that we start
  integrating human factors. We really start making this technology work for us
  to really transform health care is delivered. And as you mentioned how safe
  things are for us as health care employees.


  **Dr. Levin:** Unfortunately I do have to agree with you. I mean I think we
  had to go through this first step of this basic digitalization. I certainly
  hoped it would go faster and farther than it has. I think it is not just you
  know two guys with an opinion. There is an emerging base of data to support
  this whether we look at clinician reports of burnout related to these systems,
  the sort of slow dribble of actual studies around their impact and just the
  fact that a lot of these sort of basic ideas of human factors and design and
  workflow design they were either ignored or we gave them short shrift in the
  rush to get these systems deployed. And now we're going to have to go back and
  redo a lot of that. I think it presents a great opportunity, but we're kind of
  trying to cross this chasm right now. That's very painful. And I think
  difficult for most of our end users and it hasn't delivered as much as we
  hoped it would in terms of benefit for patients or in terms of efficient
  operations.


  **Mr. Cooperman:** Yeah I think one thing that we did do over the past 10
  years is we looked at the way health care operated with all of our analog
  tools and we mimic that with a digital tool. Instead of saying here's how it
  works from an analog perspective, how can we make this better from a digital
  perspective. We simply just mirrored that with a digital tool. And now we're
  still experiencing some of the same pains that we had with analog, but now
  we're kind of blaming them on the EMR or other technology because that's
  what's in place now. We didn't actually transform our processes or how we
  delivered care. And I think that's what's going to come next. And I think
  that's what people are hoping for. I think that's what some of the data as you
  mentioned is supporting is we really need that transformation of how care is
  delivered with our digital tools.


  **Dr. Levin:** Well we do and I also take some hope from just looking at the
  sea of technology around us and other industries. You know as I often say
  every day I work in healthcare and then I go home and live in the 21st century
  and we know it is possible to design systems that are efficient and elegant
  and safer and support new ways of doing work. Because we see it in virtually
  every other industry on a daily basis. 


  **Mr. Cooperman:** And I think we're seeing some of that bleed into healthcare
  on the positive end of it. Not to be the negative Nancy on the podcast, but
  things like our texting technology. You and I in our personal lives can reach
  friends and family quite easily via text message or mobile devices and it's a
  very great convenience of life. Some of that's bleeding into health care. We
  see some of these companies introducing tools that are HIPAA compliant. Where
  providers can use their cell phones and communicate via a text message. I see
  that as tools bleeding into healthcare. But it's still going to take some time
  for it to really mature.


  **Dr. Levin:** Well I certainly agree with you. You can see it happening. I
  wish it would happens faster and I would still argue that we still don't have
  an appreciation for the role that culture plays in high performance and health
  care in general, then also specifically when it comes to things like
  reliability and safety. You know I want to touch on one other general topic
  here, which is measurement. Because uneasy dig at this kind of discussion work
  is, well that all sounds kind of soft. You know how do you measure culture.
  How do you measure safety. And it's a good question. You know I imagine you
  share the belief that I do, which is if you're going to manage something you
  do need to be able to measure it. You know it's your compass and your
  speedometer and a couple of things as well. So I know this is a really deep
  topic. We could probably spend a whole podcast on it. But give us a couple
  highlights about how you measure safety in an organization.


  **Mr. Cooperman:** Sure. One simple way we go about doing that is we'll
  implement at an organization something like the safety that classification
  system, which is HPI system and we look at events of harm that have occurred
  and we say to ourselves, did we deviate from the generally accepted
  performance standards. And if we did this is where we have deviated in some
  way from the best practice. Then we call that a safety event and if we harmed
  a patient at a level that we would consider moderate to severe harm or death,
  we call that a serious safety event. And from that we can determine a serious
  safety event rate, which is the answer to your question. How do we measure
  ourselves. Well what is our serious safety event rate. So that's our
  measurement tool. Now if you want to dig further, as you mentioned we could
  probably spend a whole podcast or maybe a whole series of podcasts on how do
  we dig deeper on the how and the why these events occurred. We have tools and
  we have ways of looking at these programs. We have cause analysis to determine
  what some of our people causes were and what some of our system causes were.
  That's where I think we see some of our technology play and that's in our
  system causes. How did that system influence Dave and Ben to experience some
  type of error in their work. I think that's how we do some measurement and I
  think that's how we do some pretty superficial at least cause analysis to
  determine how technology plays into this.


  **Dr. Levin:** And of course there's you can develop a sort of balanced
  scorecard and you can also look at things like leading indicators, like
  compliance with checklists, user things. I'm sort of making some of this up.
  But there's this mix of leading and lagging indicators that feed into they
  alternate serious safety of that rate as well.


  **Mr. Cooperman:** That's correct. We look at three different type of
  indicators. We'll look at a leading indicator. That is something that's going
  to tell us the future. We look at real time indicators from time to time,
  that's what's going on at the moment. And then something like a serious safety
  event rate is a lagging indicator. That tells us what happened in the past and
  how we can improve in the future. So in those three different types of
  indicators. 


  **Dr. Levin:** Well Iâ€™ve had the distinct pleasure I guess is the word of
  reading very deeply into the new proposed rules from the Office of medicine
  coordinator around the exchange of health information. And one of the aspects
  that I found very fascinating, I actually did find fascinating but I don't
  think has gotten the attention it deserves are some of the proposed rules that
  relate to safety. And I want to specifically call these out, because they
  relate to the point you were just making, which is in order to develop these
  measures you have to collect information about performance. You have to be
  able to categorize that and you have to be able to carry out meaningful
  analysis to get a deeper understanding. This is a core functionality of
  creating a safer system correct.


  **Mr. Cooperman:** I would agree. Looking at the data, measuring ourselves how
  we're doing is a core functionality at some of our systems that we have in
  place. It make it easy to see what we're doing. It makes it easy to collect
  and analyze what we're doing. I'd say that's a core functionality of our
  systems, I would 100 percent agree with that.


  **Dr. Levin:** And so to tie this back to their proposed rules, they very
  explicitly address some things that have been barriers or perceived barriers
  at any rate. So it's things like sharing screenshots from your EMR, sharing
  performance information or publishing performance information. Whether it's
  economic or safety or quality or otherwise. And situation real or perceived
  and we could debate that is that some of the vendors, some EHR vendors in
  particular have rather vigorously policed the sharing of screenshots even for
  these kinds of purposes. They are concerned about protecting I guess
  intellectual property or trade secrets of some sort and that some of these,
  some of the license agreements for this technology includes effectively gag
  clauses. Things that make it at least difficult or cause the licensee to think
  more than once about whether they even want to share this kind of information.
  And I don't know that there's published literature on this. But I can say with
  confidence haven't spoke to many colleagues around the country, they've
  encountered situations where they have collected some sort of performance
  data. But their organization has been unwilling to share that publicly for
  fear of violating contractual agreement with a vendor. So to me this is like
  job one in making the system safer. We kind of talk about it. We need a method
  for collecting this information and you know sorting it, categorizing it,
  labeling it, analyzing it. Again this was sort of safety one to one that you
  and your colleagues drilled into me back in the old days of starting patient
  safety. If we don't measure it, then we really don't have a basis for
  understanding what's happening.


  **Mr. Cooperman:** Yeah I think you hit on a couple of things there and I'm
  not sure that we have data about it. I've certainly been out on the internet
  like you have Dave and Iâ€™ve heard some of the commentary on the message boards
  about the gag clauses and can one say this. Can we not say that. But one of
  the first steps that we talk about is we need to make the harm visible.
  Whether or not we measure it, which we should. I 100 percent agree. But we
  need it to be visible. Maybe our measurement is one way to make it visible.
  But we need to know about it before we can fix it. And if our rules and our
  processes and our protocols and the laws say that we can't talk about it, we
  can't share it with each other and we can't see it, then how in the world are
  we going to manage to be able to fix any of it. So we need to see it to fix
  it.


  **Dr. Levin:** Great. I want to raise one more issue with you, which is around
  the cost of all of this. Because again Iâ€™ve tried to put myself in the place
  of the skeptic and the skeptic might say, well this all sounds great
  theoretical. But it also sounds like it would take a lot of time and be really
  expensive. I mean at some point we've got to get on it. We got patients to
  take care of. We have a business to operate, the safety stuff sounds kind of
  expensive. How do you address those kinds of concerns.


  **Mr. Cooperman:** We typically a lot of times talk about HRO as a [unclear]
  in our work in each row is a great enabler of many different aspects of health
  care. One of them is a financial aspect. If we are not safe in our work, I'm
  not really sure how we're going to be all that successful from a financial
  aspect. So we're having all of these mistakes and errors in our work, it's
  going to certainly impact our bottom line. And then another perspective is
  that we're also not purchasing a whole lot of equipment or different types of
  materials. A lot of this HRO is simply how we operate. We're just changing our
  mindset many times of how we operate and I would say that's an expense we
  can't really spare. We need to be safe first and if we're operating in a safe
  manner, it's something that we can't put aside and it's going to enable us in
  many different aspects. One of those is a financial aspect.


  **Dr. Levin:** I think this is really helpful and again I say we step back and
  view these things as investments or that pay over time, both very directly in
  terms of its impact on patients, but also on the impact of the reputation of
  the organization. On the quality of the workforce that you're able to attract
  and retain their satisfaction and performance. To me these things are all
  embedded in this work and not that you can do it endlessly. We do have to have
  some guardrails here. But properly managed this is an investment that pays
  dividends over time.


  **Mr. Cooperman:** Absolutely. There's a lot of indirect benefits in our
  perspective. 


  **Dr. Levin:** So Ben you and HPI have your hands on a lot of different
  things. What's the most important or interesting thing that you're working on
  right now?


  **Mr. Cooperman:** Well I'd say the most interesting thing that I'm working on
  right now and it's maybe not one thing. It's the fact that the work we do
  touches the entire healthcare system. So we get an opportunity to work with
  clients big and small across the health care organization in the United
  States. We go from every facility you can think of from the small critical
  access facilities out in the middle of Kansas to the large facilities the
  large systems, the corporate home offices in any major city you'd think of
  maybe Denver or Dallas or even New York City. I'd say that's the most
  interesting part of our work. That's the most interesting thing we're working
  on these days is being able to work with the entire spectrum of health care in
  the United States.


  **Dr. Levin:** All right. So for this next question I want to remind you that
  the show is PG 13. So keep it family friendly. You're a pretty upbeat kind of
  guy, but I'm really curious. What's your favorite pet peeve or rant these
  days?


  **Mr. Cooperman:** I'm glad you asked that question, because I do have a pet
  peeve that I'd like to talk about and that is our perspective of who owns
  health care technology Dave. So I had the opportunity of going to speak to an
  audience recently. I'm not going to name who it was and I played a very fun
  game. At least I thought it was fun. The audience maybe would have a different
  opinion and it was a word association game Dave. And basically what I did was
  I put a tool on the screen and I asked the audience to tell me what profession
  is associated with that tool. So I gave some pretty softball questions like a
  hammer. The audience unanimously said construction worker. I put an airplane
  on the screen. And again unanimously everybody said pilot and then I put the
  names of some health care technology companies on the screen. So think Epic,
  Cerner, McKesson companies like that. And the name that everybody threw out as
  the profession that owns that is the IT people. I am Paraphrasing here, the IT
  people right. And my biggest pet peeve, my stance is that a tool like that,
  whether it's our EMR or our barcode scanner is not owned by IT. It's owned by
  all of us. It's a tool that we use to get our job done. So as we mentioned
  before it's kind of like a team effort here. So nobody really just owns it.
  Its not just IT people that own it. We all own it. That's my pet peeve. I'd
  like to change that thinking. And then we started thinking about these health
  care technology tools as our tools, not the IT people's tools.


  **Dr. Levin:** So I share that pet peeve. I could go off on quite a rant about
  this myself. But the insight that I would add to this is having had the
  pleasure and experience of working with a lot of different health systems
  around information technology. I feel like I can walk into an organization and
  in a matter of minutes I can tell is this an organization where this is a team
  sport and people are doing IT together or is this an organization where IT is
  being done to people and sadly the latter tends to predominate and it's not as
  fun, it's not as productive, it's not as safe. It's not any of the things that
  it can be. It's being done to people. So as a sort of companion or bookend to
  your pet peeve there, I couldn't agree more. And I think it's really obvious
  in most organizations whether that's happening or not.


  **Mr. Cooperman:** Yeah I think you're right there. I think sometimes when it
  comes to what's the culture when we're trying to do some measurement as we
  talked about, sometimes we can just do a measurement with a gut check when you
  walk into that organization. What does it feel like. Is IT being done to
  people or are we approaching this as a team sport. I like your words there.


  **Dr. Levin:** So for our last question today you've already offered us a lot
  of sage advice. But what's your most sage advice.


  **Mr. Cooperman:** Well my most sage advice is patience Dave. I think HRO and
  looking at HRO principles and practices, it's a journey Dave. This is not
  something you can go out and purchase and install it. Culture is not something
  you can go out and purchase and install it. So when we're talking about health
  care IT, you and I Dave, We can go out to one of those vendors whether it's
  Epic or Cerner or any other vendor we talk about, we can buy a system. We can
  buy a tool and we can just install it. That's what we talk about what is IT
  being done to us as you mentioned. But culture is very very different. You
  can't just purchase it and plug it in and expect to move forward. And it takes
  a lot of time when we're trying to shape our culture. So my sage advice is
  patience and keep putting one foot in front of the other. And over time your
  culture will look the way you hoped it would.


  **Dr. Levin:** Well again I couldn't agree more. Listeners to the podcast know
  I'm a bit of an extreme ass on this subject of culture and I own that
  publicly. I've come to believe culture is the work and pretty much everything
  else is a byproduct of that. And so not only do I agree with you about being
  patient about that cause it's hard. It's also tremendously rewarding in many
  many different ways. It's rewarding to the organization that makes the
  investment, because they're more likely to achieve their goals and it's
  rewarding to all the people involved. Because it's frankly a more humane way.
  And a more productive way for all of us to work together. So your admonition,
  your advice for us to be patient is excellent. 


  **Mr. Cooperman:** Good things come to those who wait Dave. 


  **Dr. Levin:** That's right. And persistence. The good news is there's a whole
  body of work out there now. Patient safety movement is not new. And there's
  much to be gained by studying that body of work. And there's wonderful
  opportunities to apply this as we go forward. 


  **Mr. Cooperman:** I agree. I agree.
