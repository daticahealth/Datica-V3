### Dr. Mandel responds:

**On defining SMART:** "SMART is an acronym that stands for Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technology. This idea of substitutability was the key focus. The idea, whether it was a patient or a clinician should be able to pick the apps that they want to use and interact with healthcare data using those apps." 

**On helping developers build SMART-enabled apps:** "At [docs.SMARTHealth.org](http://docs.smarthealth.org), we describe how to get started building  a browser-based app. You could even take a set of sample code that runs right in the browser, tweak it, write some new FHIR queries and get started writing code without having to download or installing packages locally."

**On the benefits of SMART on FHIR:** "SMART provides a way to embed these apps directly inside either an EHR or a patient portal, so that when you are in the middle of a clinical workflow, you can pick and choose the tools that you want to use, without having to sign into another system."

**On alerts for clinical workflows:** "Alerts are often incorporated into an EHR as a way to enforce a policy but not necessarily a way of enhancing a clinical workflow or clinical decisions. So, I think that alerts, in general, have a bad rap for good reasons."

**On the pushing standards forward:** "The best kind of arrangement that we have to push these standards forward is what I call a triad, where there is a hospital system that is interested in adopting a CDS product in the context of their EHR. If we can get all three of those together, that is by far the best way for us to develop a new feature in a specification like CDS Hooks." 

**On preparation for CDS:** "Make an early investment in FHIR and make sure that basic data types like medications, allergies and lab tests are available through a FHIR interface." 

**On CDS and what it _really_ means:** "Clinical decision support is a bit of a jargon-y term. What we really mean is third-party services, such as helpful contextual information, for clinicians while they are going through their daily workflow."
