Today, there’s lots of buzz about FHIR. You might find it everywhere from federal agencies to major technology companies with healthcare at their core. Google, Microsoft, Apple, IBM, and Oracle have all thrown their considerable weight and cloud-based resources behind FHIR and [improving interoperability in healthcare](https://www.sansorohealth.com/keys-to-simplifying-interoperability-in-healthcare/). The underlying [concepts behind FHIR](https://www.sansorohealth.com/what-is-fhir/) are important drivers of the push towards [interoperability](https://www.sansorohealth.com/best-resources-on-ehr-interoperability/).

There are a variety of resources that offer insights on FHIR, from articles examining the potential of FHIR in [electronic health records](https://www.sansorohealth.com/future-of-electronic-health-records/) to implementation case studies, predictions on the path forward, and more. If you’re looking to enhance your understanding of FHIR, learn more about how it’s being used (and whether those implementations are successful), or even gain some technical expertise about how to put it to use, you’ve come to the right place. We scoured the web and tracked down 50 of the best sources of FHIR information, from podcasts to whitepapers and fact sheets. You’ll find something on our list whether you need technical help or just a better understanding of FHIR.

## Articles Focused on FHIR

#### 1. [A Brief History of FHIR and Its Impact on Connectivity](https://medcitynews.com/2017/11/fhir-and-its-impact-on-connectivity/)

<img class="lozad float-right thumbnail drop" alt="A brief history of FHIR and its impact on connectivity min" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/60M3sIMdt8dyJUuX1a5oJw/ce77d30769d913103fcf480dee9df865/loader-rect.png" data-src="/general/blog/A-brief-history-of-FHIR-and-its-impact-on-connectivity-min.png.webp" width="180" />

This article does an excellent job outlining the history of FHIR and giving you an overview of it. If you need a brief primer on FHIR, this article may be all you need to get your mind wrapped around it. This article takes a no-nonsense look at FHIR, so expect to learn the good and bad points along with some of the author’s opinion.

_Three key takeaways from “A Brief History of FHIR and Its Impact on Connectivity:”_

#### 2. [A Comparative Analysis of HL7 FHIR and openEHR for Electronic Aggregation, Exchange and Reuse of Patient Data in Acute Care](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308903413_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_HL7_FHIR_and_openEHR_for_Electronic_Aggregation_Exchange_and_Reuse_of_Patient_Data_in_Acute_Care)

<img class="lozad float-right thumbnail drop" alt="A Comparative Analysis of HL7 FHIR and openEHR min" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/189dvqdsjh46/60M3sIMdt8dyJUuX1a5oJw/ce77d30769d913103fcf480dee9df865/loader-rect.png" data-src="/general/blog/A-Comparative-Analysis-of-HL7-FHIR-and-openEHR-min.png.webp" width="180" />

This is technically a thesis that resulted from a comparison study of [openEHR](https://www.openehr.org/) and FHIR. Since openEHR is growing rapidly in popularity, especially in places where healthcare services might be limited or severely underfunded, it may be a better option for some providers. The openEHR software is an open source, flexible standards solution but lacks the support enjoyed by FHIR.

_Key takeaways from “A Comparative Analysis of HL7 FHIR and openEHR for Electronic Aggregation, Exchange and Reuse of Patient Data in Acute Care:”_

- Learn when FHIR or openEHR might be better suited for some tasks and environments
- See real comparison data instead of a speculative analysis
- Spoiler: FHIR wins because it’s easier to learn and implement

#### 3. [Everything You Need to Know About SMART on FHIR](https://healthtechmagazine.net/article/2018/10/everything-you-need-know-about-smart-fhir-perfcon)
