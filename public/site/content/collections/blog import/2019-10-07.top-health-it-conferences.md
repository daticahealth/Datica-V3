  To make it easier for you to plan your conference attendance schedule for
  2019, we’ve compiled our picks for the 52 must-attend health IT conferences.

  As global technology continues to evolve, so does the healthcare  industry’s
  appetite for heightened connectivity and interoperability,  which empower
  healthcare organizations to streamline patient care  delivery and provide more
  efficient, better-quality care. According to data compiled by [_Health IT
  Dashboard_](https://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/quickstats.php), 96
  percent of all non-federal acute care hospitals possessed certified health IT
  in 2017. But widespread health IT adoption aside, facilities must not rest on
  their initial investments to see them through the next decade – or potentially
  even the next few years. In order to compete in this ever-evolving landscape,
  the healthcare industry must be willing to collaborate and take an active role
  in its IT implementation.
