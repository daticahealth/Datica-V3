Datica is excited to be exhibiting at HIMSS 2019 in Orlando. Visit us at booth #621 to see demonstrations of Compliant Kubernetes Service (CKS), Compliant Managed Integrations (CMI), and our newest SaaS product, the Cloud Compliance Management System (CCMS). We'll be giving away MiiR cups and copies of our new book, *Complete Cloud Compliance*. 

You can also see Datica in the Microsoft Booth, where we are a showcased partner, and the AWS booth, where we'll be giving a presentation on preparing for a 2019 HITRUST assessment. Sign up here to let us know you're coming and to schedule a HIMSS19 meeting with a Datica compliance or EHR integration expert.
