bio_short: >-
  Emily joined Datica as VP of Finance, following a long career of working with
  small, entrepreneurial companies and helping them grow into multi-million
  dollar organizations.


  Most recently Emily was with iTriage as their VP of Finance where she saw the
  healthcare industry’s challenges and opportunities for improvement. Emily
  joined when iTriage was still an early-stage growth company and helped scale
  the organization up until, and after, they were acquired by Aetna.


  Emily’s passion for startups began early in her career when she moved to
  Bozeman, MT to help her father co-found the successful men’s footwear brand
  H.S. Trask & Co. The entrepreneurial bug hasn’t left her since.
