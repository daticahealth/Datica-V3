  Mohan is an engineer by training, passionate about healthcare, data and

  Before founding Datica, Mohan worked within supply chain management and master
  data management. After securing degrees from IIT Bombay and University of
  Pennsylvania, he worked with Fortune 100 companies developing solutions for
  their supply chain and data management needs. From there, he applied lessons
  learned to healthcare at US Oncology (now part of McKesson) and Net.Orange

  Mohan moved into multi-platform development after seeing first-hand the
  challenges of an emerging mobile economy. He is a YCombinator Summer 2012
  alum. He has presented at various HIMSS and AHIP sessions, and is a noted
  speaker about compliance at healthcare events.
