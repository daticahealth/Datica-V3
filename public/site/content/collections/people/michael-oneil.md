bio_short: >-
  Following aggressive surgery and chemotherapy treatments for non-Hodgkin’s
  Lymphoma at age 28, founder & CEO Michael O’Neil emerged healthy, humbled and
  inspired. Shelving his hard-earned Georgetown law degree, he set out to tackle
  an unaddressed problem in healthcare: how to successfully engage patients and
  families in the care process.

  Drawing from his experience, Michael started GetWellNetwork on the premise
  that a more active and involved patient is a better, healthier patient.
