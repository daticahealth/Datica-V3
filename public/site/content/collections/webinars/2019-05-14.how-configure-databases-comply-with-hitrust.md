In our pursuit to make healthcare compliance more accessible to all, we’ve produced freely-available configuration guides for popular cloud services like Amazon RDS, Azure Cosmos DB, and Google Cloud SQL.

In this 30-minute webinar you'll learn:

* What's in the configuration guides and how to use them
* How these cloud configurations can easily be mapped to multiple compliance regimes, including HIPAA, GDPR, NIST, and more
* How the Datica CCMS will continuously monitor the compliance state of those configurations
