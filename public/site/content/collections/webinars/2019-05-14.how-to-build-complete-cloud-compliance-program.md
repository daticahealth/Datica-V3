  Nothing has fully tied together the compliance considerations needed for the
  cloud-native, microservices-based architectures of this modern era until now.
  Complete Cloud Compliance(3C) is the new mandate for cloud-based healthcare
  applications.


  In this practical webinar, extracted from Chapters 5 and 6 of the upcoming
  book, [Complete Cloud
  Compliance](https://datica.com/innovation/complete-cloud-compliance-chapter-2/),
  we’ll show you how compliance has failed to keep up with modern cloud
  architectures and will detail the steps you need to take to ensure cloud
  compliance.
