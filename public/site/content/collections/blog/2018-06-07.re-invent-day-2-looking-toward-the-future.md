  It's the second day of [AWS re:Invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/) and
  sessions are in full swing. I was able to attend several healthcare track
  sessions yesterday ([including
  Datica's](https://datica.com/blog/how-a-major-health-system-got-onto-aws-recapping-the-featured-session-today/
  "Datica's AWS presentation")) and the future looks bright. Healthcare is
  poised to fully embrace the cloud in 2018. The sentiment in the market has
  changed and it truly feels like we're on the edge of a major shift in the
  approach healthcare organizations are taking when building and hosting their
  software.

Transitioning to today, the sessions were a bit different — but just as exciting. I attended three talks that discussed cutting edge fields that will have a major impact on healthcare in the next 5 to 10 years. Unlike healthcare's adoption of the cloud in 2018, these new technologies will likely take a bit longer, but that's not stopping us from getting excited.

The first session I attended was the __Global Partner Summit Keynote__, which was packed with several thousand attendees. We learned about several new initiatives and programs for Amazon Partners ([Datica is an APN member, as well as a healthcare competency partner](https://aws.amazon.com/health/healthcare-partners/#Datica)). These new changes will have a profound impact on how we work with our customers — from VPC sharing to new ways to integrate with the AWS marketplace. We'll be announcing new ways to take advantage of both Datica and AWS in the future.

Session number two was entirely focused on [blockchain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSP-taqLWPQ) and blockchain technologies on AWS. We saw Intel present on [Sawtooth/Hyperledger](https://hyperledger.org/projects/sawtooth) (a competitor to [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/)) which is governed by the Linux foundation. Healthcare veterans like PokitDok use Sawtooth to enable their blockchain technology, [DokChain](https://dokchain.com/). We're excited to watch blockchain technology grow within healthcare.

The last session of the day was on Artificial Intelligence, Machine and Deep Learning. This was by far the most exciting talk of the day. There are several real world use cases that make sense for both Datica and Datica customers. From menial tasks like filling out 1500+ question security questionnaires, to providing smart analytics and predictive scoring for compliance, machine learning is a very real topic that we're exploring deeply at Datica.

If you were in attendance for any of the these sessions and want to chat about AI, Blockchain or how Datica provides an unparalleled compliance experience on AWS, stop by booth #519.
