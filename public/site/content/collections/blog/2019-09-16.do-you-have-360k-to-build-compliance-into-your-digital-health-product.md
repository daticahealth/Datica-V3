  $360,000! That’s how much it will cost a typical maker of digital health
  products to design, implement, deploy, and prove HIPAA compliance all on their
  own. That cost doesn’t even include their basic cloud subscription or the cost
  of developing the technology for their own application. We often hear
  early-stage developers say they’ve got compliance covered since they’re using
  AWS. That’s when the steep education process begins to help them understand
  they’re just at the beginning of the compliance journey with AWS and there’s
  so much more to consider to build a compliant application in the cloud.

## The TCO of Compliance in the Cloud: A Build vs. Buy Comparison 

Our goal in building the [Datica Platform](https://datica.com/platform/) was to reduce the barriers to compliance in the cloud for makers of digital health products. As part of that ongoing commitment to simplify healthcare's onramp to the cloud, we provide as much value as possible in the form of healthcare expertise we share freely with the market. It is our goal to enable our customers to focus their efforts away from compliance and cloud management and toward developing digital health applications that improve patient outcomes. 

There’s much to know about both compliance and cloud management and that knowledge requires a significant investment in time, education, personnel, and money. The intent of our newest guide, [The TCO of Compliance in the Cloud: A Build vs. Buy Comparison](https://datica.com/guide/total-cost-of-ownership-of-cloud-compliance/), is to help makers of digital health products make informed decisions about whether to “build” cloud compliance themselves, or “buy” it in the form of the Datica Platform. 

***Spoiler Alert:** It’s 10x more cost-effective to contract with Datica to deploy your application on a made-for-healthcare platform that includes not only the AWS cloud infrastructure, but also all the DevOps, DevSecOps, expertise, and proof necessary to build and market a healthcare application.* 

This guide explains the considerations of compliance and cloud management in healthcare and offers a framework to understand the activities, resources, and cost estimates for each of those considerations. We show how Datica addresses those requirements in some detail and how you as a customer benefit from building your application on the Datica Platform. These estimates are based on our extensive experience working with multiple third-party auditors and multiple cloud infrastructure providers (like [Amazon Web Services](https://datica.com/discover/aws-hipaa/), Microsoft Azure, or IBM Softlayer).

## Datica's Shared Responsibility Model

It’s important to understand this key point: AWS’s shared responsibility model grants excellent security for the security OF the cloud but customers (you) are still responsible for security IN the cloud. Orchestrating DevSecOps is just as challenging as orchestrating DevOps. The following diagram explains that a bit more, but get the full story by downloading the [complete guide](https://datica.com/guide/total-cost-of-ownership-of-cloud-compliance/).
