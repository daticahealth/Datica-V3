As part of this first report, we took a deep dive into cloud adoption in healthcare, comparing the results from the [HIMSS Cloud Studies from 2014](http://www.himss.org/library/healthcare-privacy-security/cloud-security/security-survey) and [2017](http://www.himssanalytics.org/research/essentials-brief-2017-cloud-study) and found a few surprising results, most notably, an uptick in adoption of certain areas of cloud computing and services.

[This infographic](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/1695915/Datica%20IaaS%20Infographic%202017.pdf), extracted from the Spring 2017 Quarterly Report, summarizes what we found out about the shifting definition of the cloud in healthcare.
