My first day was relatively uneventful. In fact, it was paperwork for the better part of the morning. I kind of like paperwork though, so I didn't mind (don't tell anyone).

After all the necessary forms were finished though, we headed out for some trail inspection, one of our primary duties. Fellow ranger Taylor Shotwell and I clocked almost 8 miles of snowshoeing. We didn't see a single other soul. I could get used to this. I suspect everything is going to be a bit different in the spring.

The next few weeks are going to be pretty full of:

- Hiking and snowshoeing
- Checking the remote way stations
- Black bear tracking

Oh, and I saw a fox! I barely restrained myself from shouting for Seamus Finnegan before I realized it was just covered in snow and _not_ a Patronus Charm. I'm on the look out though. You never know when you might run into a wizard. You need to be ready.
