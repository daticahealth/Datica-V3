This blog is a little dated, but much of the information is still valuable to developers. You’ll find workarounds and some technical information on coding things for web-based apps and the FHIR API. It’s all technical information aimed at people developing apps for FHIR.

## Forums Discussing FHIR

#### 49. [FHIR Community Forum](http://community.fhir.org/)

<img class="lozad float-right thumbnail drop" alt="FHIR Community Forum min" src="/assets/general/blog/loader-rect.png" data-src="/assets/general/blog/FHIR-Community-Forum-min.png.webp?fit=thumb&w=360&h=280" width="180" />

This is arguably the most popular forum for FHIR developers on the web. However, the forum isn’t very well organized, so get your keywords ready and plan to use the search feature a lot. The forum is active, and several users are typically online.

The HAPI Java server is one of the first things you find when you search for FHIR on Google after you scroll past the HL7 links. Their Java server has a lot of uses, and they’ve released a version aimed at FHIR that comes with some pre-configured options to help you get started. Their Google Group is the discussion point for all things HAPI, but many of the questions related to FHIR overall.
