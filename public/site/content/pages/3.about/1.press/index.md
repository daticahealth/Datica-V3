The two companies merged in June 2019 with a shared vision and purpose: To accelerate healthcare's transformation to a data-driven future on the cloud.
  
  Datica is headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, but is built to be a distributed team with hubs located in Madison, WI; Seattle, WA; and Portland, OR.
